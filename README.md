### AI Providers

VideoSOS supports multiple AI providers simultaneously:

- **[fal.ai](https://fal.ai)** - Comprehensive AI model infrastructure with 50+ models for image, video, and audio generation
- **[Runware.ai](https://runware.ai)** - High-performance AI inference platform with 100+ models including FLUX, Google Imagen, Ideogram, Kling, and more

You can use either provider independently or both simultaneously. Simply add your API keys in the Settings dialog (click the gear icon in the app).

#### Getting API Keys

- **FAL API Key**: Get it from [fal.ai/dashboard/keys](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys)
- **Runware API Key**: Sign up at [runware.ai](https://runware.ai) and get your key from the dashboard

Both API keys are stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers.

## For Developers

### Updating Model Information

VideoSOS includes automated scripts to keep model information up-to-date with provider APIs. Here's how to update models:

#### FAL Models

Run the FAL model update script to fetch latest models and pricing:

```bash
npm run update-fal-models
```

This script:
- Fetches all available models from FAL API
- Updates model schemas and parameters
- Syncs pricing information
- Updates `src/lib/fal.ts` and related files

#### Runware Models

For Runware models, manually enrich model configurations in `src/lib/runware-models.ts` based on [Runware documentation](https://docs.runware.ai/):

1. Check model documentation for available parameters
2. Add `availableDimensions`, `hasNegativePrompt`, `availableSteps`, etc.
3. Verify changes match actual API capabilities

**Example enrichment:**
```typescript
{
  endpointId: "google:4@1",
  label: "Gemini Flash Image 2.5",
  hasNegativePrompt: true,
  availableDimensions: [
    { width: 1024, height: 1024, label: "1024√ó1024 (1:1)" },
    { width: 1824, height: 1024, label: "1824√ó1024 (16:9)" },
    // ... more dimensions
  ],
}
```

#### Safe Updates

The project includes safe update scripts that preserve existing configurations:

```bash
# Apply FAL parameter updates safely
npm run safe-apply-parameters
```
